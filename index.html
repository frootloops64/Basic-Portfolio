            I liked computer, computer games and hardware since my dad
            bought the first PC for our home. I still remember, to this day,
            being fasinated with the MS-DOS command-line and that I started
            typing in it as if I was typing a story.

            I should have taken up Information Technology as a career
            but the 16 year old me, at the time was afraid that the industry
            would move too quickly for me to catch up. Instead, I studied
            chemistry and materials engineering. Taking up web development
            at 30+ years old is me going back to my roots and to hopefully
            get my foot in the door in the IT industry.
